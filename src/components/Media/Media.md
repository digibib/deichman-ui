### Description

Media query component, use to show/hide contents on certain screen-widths.

PS: Use this sparingly, a better approach would be using a media query in your component's css.

### Usage

```jsx
import { Media } from 'deichman-ui';

<Media>...</Media>;
```

#### Without React:

```html
<div class="media media--show-large">...</div>
```
